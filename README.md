# Mozarella

**C++ 3D Engine**
[1 week project built for fun]

--------------

I created a scene per experimentation.
Some/All scenes : Color, Model loading, Texturing, Camera movement, Light, transparency..
I stopped the project after realizing there wasn't that much added value compared to an Unreal Engine or Blender but it was fun and challenging enough, especially the sphere making.

Technologies : 
- ImGUI (very interesting quick editor)
- GLFW
- OpenGL
- Glad
- Freetype
- Assimp (importing OBJs model)
- GLM

I also added a C++ translation of Catmull-Clarks subdivision algorithm that could be useful. (Used to created a sphere from a cube)
Find it in common/math/algorithm.

This project used to be a private repository so it wasn't intended to be easily readable by someone else than me but all in all, i think it is structured enough to be clear to many.

Feel free to check or re-use the code !
